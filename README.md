# Real-time environmental data

Welcome to the repository for the Internet of Things (IoT) architecture used by the [Real-Time Water Systems Lab] at the [University of Michigan].  Here we implement the architecture as an internet-enabled sensor node and document relevant hardware, software, and firmware. 

# Hardware
Includes parts list and parts references, as well as sketches for assembly

# Software
Source code for the adaptive sampling algorithm and the Python-based, [Elastic Beanstalk] web server it runs on.  Also includes code used to test some hardware, such as the cell module and sensor communications.

# Firmware
Project files for [PSoC Creator] and all source code for the [PSoC]-based sensor node.
